# Integrated detection of spatial domains and spatially variable genes in spatial transcriptomics with SpaMCI-DL

This repository contains the implementation for [***SpaMCI-DL***]. As the paper is still under review, this repository currently provides key implementation examples demonstrating the core functionality.
Upon paper acceptance, we will:

1.Release the complete codebase
2.Add comprehensive code comments
3.Standardize all implementations for better readability
4.Provide full documentation

Current Status: The paper has been submitted to [***Communications Biology***] and is under review.
