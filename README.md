# SpaMCI-DL: A hybrid deep learning framework for integrated identification of domains and spatially variable genes in spatial transcriptomics

This repository contains the implementation for [***SpaMCI-DL***]. As the paper is still under review, this repository currently provides key implementation examples demonstrating the core functionality.
Upon paper acceptance, we will:

1.Release the complete codebase  

2.Add comprehensive code comments  

3.Standardize all implementations for better readability  

4.Provide full documentation  

Current Status: The paper has been submitted to [***Research***] and is under review.
