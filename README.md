# SpaMCI-DL: A multi-constrained interpretable deep learning framework for detecting spatially variable genes with domain specificity

This repository contains the implementation for [*SpaMCI-DL*]. As the paper is still under review, the code is temporarily unavailable. However, the full code and relevant documentation will be uploaded as soon as the paper is accepted.

Current Status: The paper has been submitted to [IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics] and is under review.

Plan: The repository will be made public immediately after acceptance.
